# Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Progression Prediction

This project is based on the AMPÂ® Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Progression Prediction (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amp-parkinsons-disease-progression-prediction/overview) Kaggle competition.

All analyses and model development were performed using **Python**, with libraries including **pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow, matplotlib, seaborn, and ydf**.


## Data Exploration

- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to examine dataset structure and identify potential clusters or patterns.

- Applied dimensionality reduction techniques such as **PCA and UMAP** to visualize groupings among samples.


## Data Processing

Handled missing values with two imputation strategies :

- Median imputation

- Linear interpolation (later recognized as problematic due to lack of linearity in NPX data)

The goal was to compare the effect of each method on model performance.


## ðŸ¤– Model Development

- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network for capturing non-linear relationships.

- Random Forest (RF) regressor as a robust baseline for noisy data and small sample sizes.


## Observations

Identified a data leakage issue: imputation was performed before train-test split or cross-validation.

The same problem was observed in subsequent strategies, highlighting the need for proper pipeline structuring.


##  Discussion

Both models struggled due to high data noise and limited predictive signal.

Clinical data were sparse, further restricting model performance.

Comparison with the competition winnerâ€™s strategy showed the importance of advanced feature engineering and data integration.


## Getting Started

To run the notebook and reproduce results:

1. The dataset is available on Kaggle, here : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amp-parkinsons-disease-progression-prediction/overview

2. Open Google Colab.

3. Upload notebook.ipynb or open it directly from the repository.

4. Run the cells sequentially â€” all required libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, matplotlib, seaborn, ydf) are pre-installed on Colab.
